# RGB-Color-Guessing-Game

The player presses on a color block. If the color is the correct randomly selected color, the user will win. If not, the user gets to try again.

The color will be shown in the following template: rgb(number1, number2, number3)

Number1 represents the red color value. 

Number2 represents the green color value. 

Number3 represents the blue color value.

UPDATE:

- Now includes player lives!

BUG(S):
- Playing and losing on medium difficulty on start up will cause the player to reset with 3 lives. To reset back to 5 lives, switch to hard mode and then back to medium.

- Feature: If you choose the correct answer when your lives counter is at 0, your lives will be reset without getting the "You Lose! Try Again" message. No need to thank me for that one, folks.
